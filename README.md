Sure! Here's a professional and clean **`README.md`** for your 2D self-balancing bot MATLAB simulation project. You can copy and paste this into your repository or documentation:

# 🤖 2D Self-Balancing Bot Simulation (MATLAB)

This project simulates a **2D self-balancing robot** using MATLAB, modeled as an **inverted pendulum on a cart**. The simulation includes system dynamics, state-space modeling, and control using an **LQR** or **PID** controller.

---

## 📌 Features

- Accurate physics-based model of a self-balancing robot  
- State-space representation of the system  
- LQR or PID controller for stabilization  
- Visualization of the robot’s angle and position  
- Optional animation of the balancing motion

## ⚙️ System Description

The robot is modeled as a **cart-pendulum system** with four state variables:

- `x`: cart position  
- `x_dot`: cart velocity  
- `theta`: angle of the pendulum from vertical  
- `theta_dot`: angular velocity of the pendulum

Control input: **Force applied to the cart (u)**

---

## 🧠 Parameters

These values define the physical characteristics of the bot:

```matlab
M = 0.5;        % Mass of cart (kg)
m = 0.2;        % Mass of pendulum (kg)
b = 0.1;        % Friction coefficient (N/m/sec)
l = 0.3;        % Distance to center of mass (m)
I = (1/3)*m*l^2;% Moment of inertia (kg.m^2)
g = 9.81;       % Gravitational acceleration (m/s^2)
```

---

## 🧮 Control Design

### ✅ LQR Controller
Linear Quadratic Regulator minimizes state error and control effort using:

```matlab
Q = diag([10, 1, 10, 1]);
R = 0.01;
K = lqr(A, B, Q, R);
```

### ⚙️ PID Controller (Optional)
For simple angular control, PID can be applied to `theta` directly (not covered in this repo yet).

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open MATLAB and run the scripts in order:

```matlab
run('params.m')             % Define physical constants
run('state_space_model.m')  % Generate system and controller
run('simulation.m')         % Simulate the robot's behavior
run('animation.m')          % Visualize balancing (optional)
```

## 🎞 Output Example

- **Angle vs Time**
- **Cart Position vs Time**
- **Animated motion of pendulum-cart system**

## 🔬 Research Applications

- Testing multi-IMU sensor fusion for stability  
- Comparing PID vs LQR performance  
- Training reinforcement learning agents to self-tune gains  
- Basis for 3D spherical balancing bots (3-wheeled ball bot)
